Laboratory # 12 - Guided Coding Exercise 1: Introduction to Methods

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1.1: Accept the Assignment**

   1. Click on the assignment link provided by your instructor.
   2. GitHub Classroom will create a **private repository** under your GitHub account.
   3. After the repository is created, click **"Go to Repository"** to view your assignment.

### **Step 1.2: Setup your Git Environment**
Only perform this if this is the first time you will setup your Git Environment

   1. Create a GitHub Account:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/signup?source=login
   ```
      
   2. Download and Install Git on your Laptop/Desktop:
   ```bash
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
   ```
   
   3. Create a Folder in your Laptop/Desktop
   4. Right-click anywhere in the created folder and select "Open Git Bash Here".
   5. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git name, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   6. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git email, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   
   7. Create your SSH Key, just follow the instructions, no need to provide filename and passphrase. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   
   8. Copy your SSH Keys into clipboard. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   
   9. Log in to your GitHub account.
   10. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click your profile picture and select Settings.
   11. In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
   12. Click the New SSH key button.
   13. In the Title field, give the key a recognizable name (e.g., "My Windows Laptop").
   14. In the Key field, CTRL + V or paste the keys copied into your clipboard. Save the key.
   15. Go Back to terminal, use command:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**

   1. On your repository page, click the green **"Code"** button.
   2. Copy the repository URL (choose HTTPS for simplicity).
   3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell) and run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <git_repo_url>
   ```
   
   4. Navigate into the cloned folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd <git_cloned_folder>
   ```

### **Step 3: Complete the Assignment**

**Laboratory # 12 - Guided Coding Exercise 1: Introduction to Methods**

   **Objective:**
   - Define what a method is and explain its purpose in Java.
   - Learn how to create and call (invoke) simple methods.

   **File Naming Convention:**
   - `MethodDemo.java`

   **Desired Output:**
   ```txt
   Hello from the greet method!
   This is my message!
   ```

   **Notable Observations (to be discussed after completing the exercise):**
   - You defined methods (greet and printMessage) outside the main method but within the same class.
   - Calling a method executes the code inside that method.
   - Methods can take parameters (like message in printMessage), which allow you to pass values to them.

   **Java Programming Best Practices:**
   - Use descriptive method names (like greet and printMessage) that indicate what the method does.
   - Keep methods concise and focused on a single, well-defined task.
   - Use comments to explain the purpose of your methods.
      
   **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

   1. Setup Class and Main Method
      - Create a file named `MethodDemo.java`.
      - Define the class `MethodDemo` and the `main` method.
      ```Java      
      public class MethodDemo {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
      
          }
      }
      ```
            
   2. Create the greet Method (Part 1)
      - After the closing curly brace of the main method, create a greet method.
      ```Java
      public static void greet() {
   
       }
      ```

   3. Create the greet Method (Part 2)
      - Inside the curly braces of the greet method, add this line: System.out.println("Hello from the greet method!");
      ```Java
      public static void greet() {
         System.out.println("Hello from the greet method!"); 
      }
      ```

   4. Call the greet Method
      - Go back to the main method (inside its curly braces).
      - Add this line to call the greet method: greet();
      ```Java
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         greet(); // Calling the greet method
      }
      ```

   5. Create the printMessage Method (Part 1)
      - After the closing curly brace of the greet method, create a printMessage Method
      ```Java
      public class MethodDemo {
          //... (main and greet methods)...
      
          public static void printMessage(String message) {
      
          }
      }
      ```

   6. Create the printMessage Method (Part 2)
      - Inside the printMessage method, add this line: System.out.println(message);
      ```Java
      public class MethodDemo {
          //... (other methods)...
      
          public static void printMessage(String message) {
              System.out.println(message);
          }
      }
      ```

   7. Call the printMessage Method
      - In your main method, add this line to call printMessage: printMessage("This is my message!");
      ```Java
      public class MethodDemo {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              greet();
              printMessage("This is my message!");
          }
      
          //... (other methods)...
      }
      ```

   8. Compile and Run
       - Save the file as `MethodDemo.java`.
       - Compile the code using `javac MethodDemo.java` in your terminal or command prompt.
       - Run the compiled code using `java MethodDemo`.

   **Conclusion**
   This exercise introduced the concept of methods in Java. Methods are essential for organizing and reusing code. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, more manageable blocks, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. By creating and calling methods, you can improve the structure and efficiency of your Java programs.

### **Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub**
Once you've completed your changes, follow these steps to upload your work to your GitHub repository.

1. Check the status of your changes:
   Open the terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This command shows any modified or new files.
   
2. Stage the changes:
   Add all modified files to staging:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   
3. Commit your changes:
   Write a meaningful commit message:
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Submitting OBJPROG Week 05 - Laboratory # 12"
   ```
   
4. Push your changes to GitHub:
   Upload your changes to your remote repository:
   
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
